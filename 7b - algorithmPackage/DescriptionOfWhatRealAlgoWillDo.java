public interface DescriptionOfWhatRealAlgoWillDo { //example of how interfaces are used in real world..... you share an interface to another team that will have to use whatever you're going to create.... so that they can write code that would work w/the thing that you're creating but haven't yet created.... by creating a dummy implementation of what you'll create.... becausd all they'd have to do is instead of creating dummyImplementation object.... they could just create realImplementation object..... aka. literall just switch the new DummyImplementation () to new RealImplementation()  on the same line.... cuz both can take the form of the interface 
	public int applyTheAlgorithmOnGivenInputs(int num1, int num2); //the 1 method in the class that your team is working to create

//But First!!!! understand how Hashtable works....... I get the using the hash function on the key to determine which index / bucket to go too.... but how do we differentiate b/w the things in a bucket? i.e. let's say I'm updating something that's in the 3rd bucket.... then I'd imagine i'd provide the key to get my object.... the key would go through hash function to get the correct hashcode aka. thing used to decide which bucket / index to go to...... now that i'm in the right bucket..... how do i know which of the things in the bucket I wanted to update?..... we could just use the key that I passed in..... is that how it's done?
class PlayWithHashtableAndHashmp { //Play with Hashtable and Hashmap class... similar to linkedlist or ArrayList can probably just replace 1 line and code should work for both cuz... implementing same Map ADT (by implementing the same Map interface) - the ADT that maps keys to values
	public static void main(String[] args){

	}
}
